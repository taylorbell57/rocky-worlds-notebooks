## Preface

A collection of Eureka! Control Files (.ecf files) are copied into the cells of this notebook. These parameters are setup with generally reasonable and performant settings and are based on the findings/recommendations of Gordon+2025. Flux-calibration analyses will start with the same _rateints.fits files downloaded from MAST for the quicklook data and will then be processed through Stages 2--4cal of Eureka!.

For the quicklook processing, only the Stage 4cal Eureka! Control File will need to be adjusted based on the parameters of the particular planet that your data observed.

All told, running Stages 2--4cal should take a couple of minutes.
